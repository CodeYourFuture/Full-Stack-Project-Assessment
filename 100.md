# Level 100 - Week 1 - Front End

By the end of this level you will have a React website that

- Fulfils all of the requirements in the ReadMe
- Uses static data for the website

## Static Data

By static data I mean that we will use a variable to hold the data that we would expect to get from the API in a variable in JavaScript.

You can find an example of this data in `exampleresponse.json` at the root of this repository.

## Required Features

1. Videos should be loaded from a variable containing the JSON
2. For each video, show a React component that shows
   - The videos title
   - When the video was posted
   - An embedded video
   - The number of votes the video has
   - A button that when clicked removes the video
3. On each video submission there should be two buttons
   - "Up Vote" - This increases the vote score when clicked
   - "Down Vote" - This decreases the vote score when clicked
4. On the page there must be another React component that will Add a Video. It should include
   - A Unique ID (automatically generated)
   - A Title (added by the user)
   - A Url (added by the user)

## Embedding Videos from Youtube

You can embed videos from YouTube by using a HTML feature called `iframe`s.

```HTML
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="VIDEO_URL_GOES_HERE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
```

Place that HTML snippet in a React component and replace "`VIDEO_URL_GOES_HERE`" with the URL of the video you want to display to embed a video.
