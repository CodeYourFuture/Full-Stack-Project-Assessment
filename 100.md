# Level 100 - Week 1 - Front End

By the end of this level you will have a React website that

- Fulfils all of the requirements in the ReadMe
- Uses static data for the website

## Static Data

By static data I mean that we will use a variable to hold the data that we would expect to get from the API in a varialbe in JavaScript.

You can find an example of this data in `exampleresponse.json` at the root of this repository.

## Required Features

1. Videos should be loaded from a variable containing the JSON
2. For each video, show a React component that shows
   - The videos title
   - When the video was posted
   - An embedded video

## Embedding Videos from Youtube

You can embed videos from YouTube by using a HTML feature called `iframes`.

```HTML
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="VIDEO_URL_GOES_HERE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
```

Place that HTML snippet in a React component and replace "`VIDEO_URL_GOES_HERE`" with the URL of the video you want to display to embed a video.
