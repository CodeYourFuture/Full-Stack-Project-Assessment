# Level 100 - Week 1 - Front End

By the end of this level you will have a React website that

- Fulfils all of the requirements in the ReadMe
- Uses static data for the website

## Project

You will find an empty project in the `client` directory for you to work in.

To run the project you should first run these commands

```
cd client
npm install
```

then you can launch the website with

```
npm run start
```

## Static Data

By static data, we mean that we will use a javascript variable to hold the data that we would expect to get from the API.

You can find an example of this data in `exampleresponse.json` at the root of this repository.

## Design

You are welcome to use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) or any other design framework to help you build this app.

## Required Features

1. Videos should be loaded from a local javascript variable containing the data included in `exampleresponse.json`
2. For each video, display a React component that contains
   - The videos title
   - When the video was posted
   - An embedded video
   - The number of votes the video has
   - A button that when clicked removes the video
3. On each video submission there should be two buttons
   - "Up Vote" - This increases the vote score when clicked
   - "Down Vote" - This decreases the vote score when clicked
4. On the page there must be another React component that will add a Video.
   - It should include fields to add a
     - Title
     - Url
   - When a button is clicked the video should be added to the list

## Embedding Videos from YouTube

You can embed videos from YouTube by using a HTML feature called `iframe`s.

```HTML
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="VIDEO_URL_GOES_HERE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
```

Place that HTML snippet in a React component and replace "`VIDEO_URL_GOES_HERE`" with the URL of the video you want to display to embed a video.
