# Level 250 - Week 2 - Connecting Front End and Back End

In this step you should connect your React and Node apps so that data is stored and retrieved from the API

When completed, you should not be reading data from a local variable in your React app, you should be using `fetch` to retrieve your data from the API you have just built.

## Local Development

Since you're working on your API locally you'll need to use an a local url. By default this will be configure to

```url
http://127.0.0.1/5000
```

When you have your server running you should be able to test if it's working by going to that url and viewing all of the videos in your API.
