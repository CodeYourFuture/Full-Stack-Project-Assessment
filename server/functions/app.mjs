// Netlify wrapper for express.js

// This will convert your express.JS application into a serverless lambda that is compatible by AWS Lambda and Netlify Functions.
// Note that this has a large performance impact as your entire express system needs to load up for every single request.
// Also each request runs in isolation so you are unable to share or cache values in your codebase.
// For example the database connection will be recreated at every call
