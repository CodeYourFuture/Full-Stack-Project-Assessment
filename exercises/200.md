# Level 200 - Week 2 - UX Improvements

Your MVP has been well received by your friends, but they found it lacking in some regards. The main comments you received were:

- They found clicking on the link and getting redirected was not convenient, they got lost while opening up the tabs
- They said the styling of the page was not too welcoming, and suggested you add some colours to it.

## New requirements

You have now received some comments on your work! Sometimes these comments are immediately actionable. For example if they would have said they wanted the titles to be coloured red, you would know immediately what to do! This is not the case here, so we need to turn the comments above into actionable stories!

## Embedded videos

Your friends found the link clicking tedious, and they realized something's not right - this should be made easier - but didn't really know what to do. Fortunately you do: you realize videos should be embedded!

Instructions about how to embed a YouTube video can be found here

https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/171780?hl=en

You can embed videos from YouTube by using a HTML feature called `iframe`s.

```HTML
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/{VIDEO_ID_GOES_HERE}" title="YouTube video player" frameBorder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowFullScreen></iframe>
```

Place that HTML snippet in your React component and replace "`VIDEO_ID_GOES_HERE`" with the ID of the video you want to display to embed a video.

The ID of a video can be found by looking at the URL of the video. For example, for the video

```html
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUeyrEN14Rk
```

The ID would be

```html
FUeyrEN14Rk
```

## Better design

Your friends also raised that your website might be lacking in a nice design. This is a good opportunity to start styling your website by editing the `client/src/index.css` file. If you lack ideas on how your site should look search for templates on the internet. Here are some resources to try:

- [MUI](https://mui.com/) is a React based framework that hosts some common components that you can easily include on your website.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is another well known framework that hosts common components. It is not tied to React and can work with any framework, but this means you'll need to convert anything you wish to use to React components yourself.
- [Foundation](https://get.foundation/sites/docs/installation.html) is a very similar framework to Bootstrap with similar features. It is also not React based.

You can also have a look at some plain HTML5 templates that you can use for inspiration and then convert to React. Some nice examples can be found on [Html5Up](https://html5up.net/). Make sure any template you use are licensed properly - the Creative Commons CC-BY license is common on free templates, which allows you to fully reuse the template, but require you to link back to the creator somewhere visible on your website, like the footer or the About page.

You can also check the [example solution](https://cyf-fsa-solution.netlify.app/) as well, although that does not follow major, good UX guidelines.

## Making your website accessible

Once you finish with your styling make sure to run an accessibility check on the final page. To do that follow the steps below:

1. Run a [Lighthouse test](https://supercooldesign.co.uk/blog/how-to-run-a-lighthouse-audit) on your prototype in Chrome
2. Follow the suggestions to fix the accessibility errors until your score is green. Save your result as HTML and include it in your Pull Request to show your work.
3. Add a title to your iframe and make the value the title of the video
4. Add a focus state with CSS to highlight what control is active
5. Tab through your page and make sure you can click all the controls without using a mouse (edited)

## Deployment

Once you finish with your changes, and merge your code, make sure it is accessible on Netlify as well.
