# Level 130 - Week 1 - Frontend

Level 130 will finalize our MVP by creating the frontend part, making sure that you have a simple page that displays the videos from your database.

## Project setup

Since we are running a monorepo you can launch the frontend the same way you launch the backend:

```sh
npm run dev
```

The code you put under `client/src` will then be accessible on http://localhost:3000

## Implementing your frontend

You will need to:

- Have a React component that displays a recommendation

  - It should show the video's title
  - If you click on the title it it should redirect you to the YouTube page

- Have another React component that acts as a container for the above component

- Make sure that on page load the list of videos are loaded from the API using `fetch` and displayed using the components above

## API access from React

Since we are doing a monorepo design the API is accessible on the same route as the frontend. This means you are able to use calls like `fetch("/api/videos")` and it will properly connect to your backend. You don't need to worry about CORS requirements either.

Checkout this cheat-sheet to help you with the types of requests you'll need to be using with `fetch`

## Styling

While you are free to do styling on the result, as this is only an MVP you shouldn't spend too much time making the website look nice.

## Deployment

If you have set up Netlify deployment in [level 120](./120.md) this should now work automatically for the frontend as well. Make sure to test it out though.

## Example

## Next Level

Once finished you can go to [Level 150](./150.md)
