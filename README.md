# Video Recommendation App

## Background

Before you continue to final projects we have to make sure that you can meaningfully contribute to a technical project.

This means that we need to be sure that you can create and deploy Full Stack application.

## Challenge

In this project, you will be building up a small project that allows you to share your favourite YouTube videos with the world. We will be starting up with a very small MVP (Minimal Viable Product), and build on top of it to make it nicer and more useful.

## User stories 👩🏽‍💻

Most of the core features for this project have been captured on **user story** issues. You can view all the user story issues on the project planning board: [User story issues](https://github.com/orgs/CodeYourFuture/projects/169/views/3). User story issues define a particular feature through a user story. They also link through to other issues you'll need to implement for this user story to be complete.

## Requirements

All the requirements for this project are captured as issues that you can find on this planning board: [Full Stack Assessment Planner](https://github.com/orgs/CodeYourFuture/projects/169/views/2)

**Note:** Some of the issues are optional which means that you can build a working project without them. However, to make something really impressive you will need to complete as much as you can.

**Note:** You can design the website to look however you like.

## Using this project for the launch project and other portfolio pieces

While you are free to use this codebase for your future projects we recommend against it. This project is set up in a way to make it easy to understand, but lacks a lot of features that would be otherwise helpful.

For launch projects and future portfolio pieces we recommend that you take a look at the [Code Your Future Starter Kit](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/cyf-final-project-starter-kit). This assessment project is a simplified version of the starter kit, with a lot of the features removed to keep it light and more understandable. In fact, some of the challenges that we ask you is to re-add these features yourself, like support for linting.

Since these features will already be present in the starter kit, hence it will be a much better starting point for you to work with. And since it uses the same libraries and setup that you will learn here, we believe you will feel immediately familiar with it as well.
