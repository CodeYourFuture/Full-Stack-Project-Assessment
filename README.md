# Video Recommendation App

## Background

Before you continue to final projects we have to make sure that you can meaningfully contribute to a technical project.

This means that we need to be sure that you can create and deploy Full Stack application.

## Challenge

In this project you will be building a project that fulfills the following User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to view a list of all YouTube videos posted on the site
- As a user, I want to be able to post videos that I like from YouTube to my website.
- As a user, I want to be able to delete videos from the website that I no longer like.
- As a user, I want to be able to watch the videos embedded in the website.
- As a user, I want to be able to "Up Vote" a video if I like it.
- As a user, I want to be able to "Down Vote" a video if I dislike.

You don't need to worry about storing the video content itself - we'll rely on YouTube for this.

## Levels

This project is split into several levels that you should complete each week of the three week project.

You can find each of the levels split into separate files, linked below.
