# Full Stack Project Assessment

## Background

Before you continue to final projects we have to make sure that you can meaningfully contribute to a technical project.

This means that we need to be sure that you can create a Full Stack App.

## Challenge - "Video Recommendation Engine!"

In this project you will be building a project that fulfills the following User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to post videos that I like to my website.
- As a user, I want to be able to delete videos from the website that I no longer like.
- As a user, I want to be able to watch the videos embedded in the website.
- As a user, I want to be able to "Up Vote" a video if I like it.
- As a user, I want to be able to "Down Vote" a video if I dislike.
- As a user, I don't want to see any videos that have a negative score.

## Levels

This project is split into several levels that you should complete each week of the three week project.

You can find each of the levels split into separate files, linked below.

**Note:** Some of the levels are optional which means that you will build a working project without them. However, to make something really impressive you will need to complete as much as you can.

### Week 2 - Back End (without Database)

- [Level 200](./200.md)
