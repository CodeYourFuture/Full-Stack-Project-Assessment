# Level 300 - Week 3 - Database

In this final stage of the project you will be adding a database to your API so that data is persisted.

You can use any database of your choosing - most likely PostgreSQL or MongoDB.

## Setting up your Database

To setup your database prefer using PostgreSQL on Render.

Please read the guide at https://syllabus.codeyourfuture.io/guides/deployment-render/creating-a-postgres-db on how to install PostgreSQL on Render

Ask for help on Slack if you need help with this

## Success Criteria

When this stage has been completed all of your data should exist only in your database - no data should be stored in your API or in your React app
