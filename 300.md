# Level 300 - Week 3 - Database

In this final stage of the project you will be adding a database to your API so that data is persisted.

You can use any database of your choosing - most likely PostgreSQL or MongoDB.

## Setting up your Database

To setup your database you can use either

- MongoDB
  - Using MongoDB Atlas
  - https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas
- PostgreSQL
  - Using Heroku

Ask for help on Slack if you need help with this

## Success Criteria

When this stage has been completed all of your data should exist only in your database - no data should be stored in your API or in your React app
