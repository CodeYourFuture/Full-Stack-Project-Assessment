# Deploying a WebSocket proxy in front of your own Postgres instance

**This package comes configured to connect to a Neon database over a secure (`wss:`) WebSocket. If you're using a Neon database, you can ignore what follows.**

But you can also run your own WebSocket proxy, and configure it to allow onward connections to your own Postgres instances.

First, you'll need to set up the proxy itself somewhere public-facing (or on `localhost` for development). See https://github.com/neondatabase/wsproxy for the Go code and instructions.

There are then two ways you can secure this:

1. Set up nginx as a TLS proxy in front of `wsproxy`. Example shell commands to achieve this can be found below. Onward traffic to Postgres is not secured by this method, so Postgres should be running on the same machine or be reached over a private network.

2. Use experimental pure-JS Postgres connection encryption via [subtls](https://github.com/jawj/subtls). There's no need for nginx in this scenario, and the Postgres connection is encrypted end-to-end. You get this form of encryption if you set both `neonConfig.useSecureWebSocket`  and `neonConfig.forceDisablePgSSL` to `false`, and append `?sslmode=verify-full` (or similar) to your connection string. TLS version 1.3 must be supported by the Postgres back-end. **Please note that subtls is experimental software and this configuration is not recommended for production use.**

Second, you'll need to set some [configuration options](CONFIG.md) on this package: at a minimum theÂ `wsProxy` option and (if using experimental encryption) `subtls` and `rootCerts`.


## Example shell commands

To deploy `wsproxy` behind nginx (for TLS) on a host `ws.example.com` running Ubuntu 22.04 (and Postgres locally), you'd do something similar to the following.

Before you start:

1. Ensure port 443 is accessible on this machine. You might need to change firewall settings with your platform provider.

2. Upgrade to Ubuntu 22.04 if on an earlier version (golang is too old on older releases):

```bash
sudo su  # do this all as root
apt update -y && apt upgrade -y && apt dist-upgrade -y
apt autoremove -y && apt autoclean -y
apt install -y update-manager-core
do-release-upgrade  # and answer yes to all defaults
```

Then:

```bash
sudo su  # do this all as root

export HOSTDOMAIN=ws.example.com  # edit the domain name for your case

# if required: install postgres + create a password-auth user

apt install -y postgresql

echo 'create database wstest; create user wsclear; grant all privileges on database wstest to wsclear;' | sudo -u postgres psql

sudo -u postgres psql  # and run: \password wsclear

perl -pi -e 's/^# IPv4 local connections:\n/# IPv4 local connections:\nhost all wsclear 127.0.0.1\/32 password\n/' /etc/postgresql/14/main/pg_hba.conf

service postgresql restart
