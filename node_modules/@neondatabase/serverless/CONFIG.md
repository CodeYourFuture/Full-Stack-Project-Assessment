# Options and configuration

## `neon(...)` function

The `neon(...)` function returns a query function that can be used both as a tagged-template function and as an ordinary function:

```typescript
import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL);

// as a tagged-template function
const rowsA = await sql`SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = ${postId}`;

// as an ordinary function (exactly equivalent)
const rowsB = await sql('SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = $1', [postId]);
```

By default, the query function returned by `neon(...)` returns only the rows resulting from the provided SQL query, and it returns them as an array of objects where the keys are column names. For example:

```typescript
import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL);
const rows = await sql`SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = ${postId}`;
// -> [{ id: 12, title: "My post", ... }]
```

However, you can customise the return format of the query function using the configuration options `fullResults` and `arrayMode`. These options are available both on the `neon(...)` function and on the query function it returns (but only when the query function is called as an ordinary function, not as a tagged-template function).


### `arrayMode: boolean`

When `arrayMode` is true, rows are returned as an array of arrays instead of an array of objects: 

```typescript
import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL, { arrayMode: true });
const rows = await sql`SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = ${postId}`;
// -> [[12, "My post", ...]]
```

Or, with the same effect:

```typescript
import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL);
const rows = await sql('SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = $1', [postId], { arrayMode: true });
// -> [[12, "My post", ...]]
```


### `fullResults: boolean`

When `fullResults` is true, additional metadata is returned alongside the result rows, which are then found in the `rows` property of the return value. The metadata matches what would be returned by node-postgres:

```typescript
import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL, { fullResults: true });
const results = await sql`SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = ${postId}`;
/* -> {
  rows: [{ id: 12, title: "My post", ... }],
  fields: [
    { name: "id", dataTypeID: 23, ... },
    { name: "title", dataTypeID: 25, ... },
    ...
  ],
  rowCount: 1,
  rowAsArray: false,
  command: "SELECT"
} 
*/
```

Or, with the same effect:

```typescript
import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL);
const results = await sql('SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = $1', [postId], { fullResults: true });
// -> { ... same as above ... }
```


### `fetchOptions: Record<string, any>`

The `fetchOptions` option can also be passed to either `neon(...)` or the query function. This option takes an object that is merged with the options to the `fetch` call.

For example, to increase the priority of every database `fetch` request:

```typescript
import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL, { fetchOptions: { priority: 'high' } });
const rows = await sql`SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = ${postId}`;
```

Or to implement a `fetch` timeout:

```typescript
import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL);
const abortController = new AbortController();
const timeout = setTimeout(() => abortController.abort('timed out'), 10000);
const rows = await sql(
  'SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = $1', [postId], 
  { fetchOptions: { signal: abortController.signal } }
);  // throws an error if no result received within 10s
clearTimeout(timeout);
```


## `transaction(...)` function

The `transaction(queriesOrFn, options)` function is exposed as a property on the query function. It allows multiple queries to be executed within a single, non-interactive transaction.

The first argument to `transaction()`, `queriesOrFn`, is either (1) an array of queries or (2) a non-`async` function that receives a query function as its argument and returns an array of queries.

The array-of-queries case looks like this:

```javascript
import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL);
const showLatestN = 10;

const [posts, tags] = await sql.transaction([
  sql`SELECT * FROM posts ORDER BY posted_at DESC LIMIT ${showLatestN}`,
  sql`SELECT * FROM tags`,
], { 
  isolationLevel: 'RepeatableRead',
  readOnly: true, 
});
```

Or as an example of the function case:

```javascript
const [authors, tags] = await neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL)
  .transaction(txn => [
    txn`SELECT * FROM authors`,
    txn`SELECT * FROM tags`,
  ]);
```

The optional second argument to `transaction()`, `options`, has the same keys as the options to the ordinary query function -- `arrayMode`, `fullResults` and `fetchOptions` -- plus three additional keys that concern the transaction configuration. These transaction-related keys are: `isolationMode`, `readOnly` and `deferrable`.

Note that options **cannot** be supplied for individual queries within a transaction. Query and transaction options must instead be passed as the second argument of the `transaction()` function. For example, this `arrayMode` setting is ineffective (and TypeScript won't compile it): `await sql.transaction([sql('SELECT now()', [], { arrayMode: true })])`. Instead, use `await sql.transaction([sql('SELECT now()')], { arrayMode: true })`.


### `isolationMode`

This option selects a Postgres [transaction isolation mode](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/transaction-iso.html). If present, it must be one of: `'ReadUncommitted'`, `'ReadCommitted'`, `'RepeatableRead'` or `'Serializable'`.


### `readOnly`

If `true`, this option ensures that a `READ ONLY` transaction is used to execute the queries passed.


### `deferrable`

If `true` (and if `readOnly` is also `true`, and `isolationMode` is `'Serializable'`), this option ensures that a `DEFERRABLE` transaction is used to execute the queries passed.


## `neonConfig` configuration

In most cases, there are two ways to set configuration options:

1. Import `neonConfig` from the package and set global default options on that. 
2. Set options on individual `Client` instances using their `neonConfig` property.

For example:

```javascript
import { Client, neonConfig } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
import ws from 'ws';

// set default option for all clients
neonConfig.webSocketConstructor = ws;

// override the default option on an individual client
const client = new Client(process.env.DATABASE_URL);
client.neonConfig.webSocketConstructor = ws;
```

A few configuration options can only be set globally, and these are noted as such below.


#### `webSocketConstructor: typeof WebSocket | undefined`

Set this parameter if you're using the driver in an environment where the `WebSocket` global is not defined, such as Node.js, and you need transaction or session support.

For example:

```javascript
import { neonConfig } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
import ws from 'ws';
neonConfig.webSocketConstructor = ws; 
```


### Advanced configuration

If you're using `@neondatabase/serverless` to connect to a Neon database, you usually **won't** need to touch the following configuration options. These options are intended for testing, troubleshooting, and supporting access to non-Neon Postgres instances via self-hosted WebSocket proxies.


#### `poolQueryViaFetch: boolean`

**Experimentally**, when `poolQueryViaFetch` is `true` and no listeners for the `"connect"`, `"acquire"`, `"release"` or `"remove"` events are set on the `Pool`, queries via `Pool.query()` will be sent by low-latency HTTP `fetch` request.

Default: currently `false` (but may be `true` in future).

Note: this option can only be set globally, **not** on an individual `Client` instance.


#### `fetchConnectionCache: boolean`

**Experimentally**, when `fetchConnectionCache` is `true`, queries carried via HTTP `fetch` will make use of a connection cache (pool) on the server.

Default: currently `false` (but may be `true` in future).

Note: this option can only be set globally, **not** on an individual `Client` instance.


#### `fetchEndpoint: string | ((host: string, port: number | string) => string)`

Set `fetchEndpoint` to set the server endpoint to be sent queries via http fetch. 

This may be useful for local development (e.g. to set a port that's not the default 443).

Provide either the full endpoint URL, or a function that takes the database host address and port and returns the full endpoint URL (including protocol).

Default: `host => 'https://' + host + '/sql'`

Note: this option can only be set globally, **not** on an individual `Client` instance.


#### `fetchFunction: any`

The `fetchFunction` option allows you to supply an alternative function for making http requests. The function must accept the same arguments as native `fetch`.

Default: `undefined`.

Note: this option can only be set globally, **not** on an individual `Client` instance.


#### `wsProxy: string | (host: string, port: number | string) => string`

If connecting to a non-Neon database, the `wsProxy` option should point to [your WebSocket proxy](DEPLOY.md). It can either be a string, which will have `?address=host:port` appended to it, or a function with the signature `(host: string, port: number | string) => string`. Either way, the protocol must _not_ be included, because this depends on other options. For example, when using the `wsproxy` proxy, the `wsProxy` option should look something like this:

```javascript
// either:
neonConfig.wsProxy = (host, port) => `my-wsproxy.example.com/v1?address=${host}:${port}`
// or (with identical effect):
neonConfig.wsProxy = 'my-wsproxy.example.com/v1';
```

Default: `host => host + '/v2'`.


#### `pipelineConnect: "password" | false`

To speed up connection times, the driver will pipeline the first three messages to the database (startup, authentication and first query) if `pipelineConnect` is set to `"password"`. Note that this will only work if you've configured cleartext password authentication for the relevant user and database. 

If your connection doesn't support password authentication, set `pipelineConnect` to `false` instead.

Default: `"password"`.


#### `coalesceWrites: boolean`

When this option is `true`, multiple network writes generated in a single iteration of the JavaScript run-loop are coalesced into a single WebSocket message. Since node-postgres sends a lot of very short messages, this may reduce TCP/IP overhead.

Default: `true`.


#### `forceDisablePgSSL: boolean`

This option disables TLS encryption in the Postgres protocol (as set via e.g. `?sslmode=require` in the connection string). Security is not compromised if used in conjunction with `useSecureWebSocket = true`.

Default: `true`.


#### `useSecureWebSocket: boolean`

This option switches between secure (the default) and insecure WebSockets. 

To use experimental pure-JS encryption, set `useSecureWebSocket = false` and `forceDisablePgSSL = false`, and append `?sslmode=verify-full` to your database connection string.

**Remember that pure-JS encryption is currently experimental and not suitable for use in production.**

Default: `true`.


#### `subtls: any`

**Only when using experimental pure-JS TLS encryption**, you must supply the [subtls](https://github.com/jawj/subtls) TLS library to the `subtls` option like so:

```typescript
import { neonConfig } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
import * as subtls from 'subtls';
neonConfig.subtls = subtls;
```

Default: `undefined`.


#### `rootCerts: string /* PEM format */`

**Only when using experimental pure-JS TLS encryption**, the `rootCerts` option determines what root (certificate authority) certificates are trusted.

Its value is a string containing zero or more certificates in PEM format.

Default: `""` (the empty string).


#### `pipelineTLS: boolean`

**Only when using experimental pure-JS encryption**, the driver will pipeline the SSL request message and TLS Client Hello if `pipelineTLS` is set to `true`. Currently, this is only supported by Neon database hosts, and will fail when communicating with an ordinary Postgres or pgbouncer back-end.

Default: `false`.
