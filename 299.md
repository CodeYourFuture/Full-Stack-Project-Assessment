# Level 250 - Week 2 - Back End - Stretch Goals

## 1) Ordered data

When you return all of the videos from endpoint you should add an optional parameter that will change the ordering of the data

```sh
/?order=asc
```

and

```sh
/?order=desc
```

When you receive `asc` the videos should be returned in ascending order by the number of votes. i.e. starting with the lowest number of votes.

When you receive `desc` the videos should be returned in descending order by the number of votes. i.e. starting with the highest number of votes.
